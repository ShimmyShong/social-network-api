## Description
This is an API for a social network web application where people can share thoughts, react to other thoughts, and create a friend list. It is using MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM. I learned a lot about using MongoDB instead of SQL with this project, and even though it was hard to make the switch, I overall preferred it over SQL in the end!
